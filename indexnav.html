            <p>Meher Baba (born Merwan Sheriar Irani; 25 February [O.S. 17 February] 1894 â€“ 31 January 1969) was an Indian spiritual master who said he was the Avatar, or God in human form, of the age.[1][2][3] A spiritual figure of the 20th century,[4][5] he had a following of hundreds of thousands of people, mostly in India, with a smaller number of followers in North America, Europe, South America, and Australia.[2][6][7]

                Meher Baba's map of consciousness has been described as "a unique amalgam of Sufi, Vedic, and Yogic terminology".[8] He taught that the goal of all beings was to awaken to consciousness of their own divinity, and to realise the absolute oneness of God.[2][9]
                
                At the age of 19, Meher Baba began a seven-year period of spiritual transformation, during which he had encounters with Hazrat Babajan, Upasni Maharaj, Sai Baba of Shirdi, Tajuddin Baba, and Narayan Maharaj. In 1925, he began a 44-year period of silence, during which he communicated first using an alphabet board and by 1954 entirely through hand gestures using an interpreter.[9] Meher Baba died on 31 January 1969 and was entombed at Meherabad. His tomb, or "samadhi", has become a place of pilgrimage for his followers, often known as "Baba lovers".[6]</p>
                <p>Overview of teachings
                    Meher Baba's teachings concerned the nature and purpose of life. He described the phenomenal world as illusory, and taught that the Universe is imagination. He taught that God alone exists, and each soul is God passing through imagination in order to realise its own divinity.[10] He advised followers wishing to attain God-realisation, emphasizing love and selfless-service.[11] His other teachings included discussion of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, and those on the various stages of the spiritual path, which he termed involution. God Speaks and Discourses are regarded as among his most important written works.[12][13]
                    
                    For decades he declined to speak and later refrained from communicating via written language. This practice has remained a topic of discussion among some of his followers.[14][15]</p>
                    <p>Wider influence
                        His legacy includes the Avatar Meher Baba Charitable Trust he established in India, and a handful of centers for information and pilgrimage. He has influenced pop culture creators and introduced the common phrase "Don't worry; be happy". This was used in Bobby McFerrin's hit 1988 song of the same name. Among his followers were well-known musicians such as Melanie Safka and Pete Townshend, as well as journalists including Sir Tom Hopkinson.[16][17]
                        
                        In 1971, Meher Baba's following in the United States was estimated at 7,000. Some commentators have suggested that the size of the movement has been underestimated due to the rarity of proselytising by Meher Baba's followers, and that in 1975, the movement was larger than the more visible Hare Krishna movement.[16]
                        
                        Meher Baba was accepted as the leader of a Sufi organization based in California which he renamed Sufism Reoriented.[18] Meher Baba's Sufi influence is said to have drawn from Sai Baba of Shirdi, whom Meher Baba designated as a Qutb.[19] However, some commentators have asserted that Meher Baba's interpretation of Sufism shared very few similarities with the Sufi Movement apart from universalism and anti-dogmatism.[20]</p>
